# Garage Shelf

Space saving curvy garage utility shelf with cutouts and support/alignment grooves, sized to fit in a narrow space under a light switch and top two shelves designed for puppy food.  My first Maslow project.  Designed with Autodesk Fusion360 for 1/2&quot; ply.  Had a few accuracy issues with the edges of Maslow cut area.
